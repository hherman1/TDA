Here I will log some work that has been done:

Warden:

Cleaned: removed punctuation, sent all to lower case
Filtered by PoS data: took the complement of the 'important words' of PoS, stored in PoS.clean.filter.complement,
 then took the complement of this set in the set of unique words from warden (warden.clean.unique), which removed
 about 3000 words, and is stored in warden.clean.filter

 Next step: Density filtering.
 The complement filtering should remove "trash" words like "the", "a", etc. so density filtering on what remains is 
 unlikely to procuce a meaningless selection.
